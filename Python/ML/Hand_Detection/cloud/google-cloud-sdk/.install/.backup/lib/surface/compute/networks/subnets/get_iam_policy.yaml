    brief: Get the IAM policy for a Google Compute Engine subnetwork.
    DESCRIPTION: |
            *{command}* displays the IAM policy associated with a Google
            Compute Engine subnetwork in a project. If formatted as JSON,
            the output can be edited and used as a policy file for
            set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field
            identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
            concurrent policy updates; see
            $ {parent} set-iam-policy for additional details.
    EXAMPLES: |
            To print the IAM policy for a given subnetwork, run:

              $ {command} --region=us-central1 my-subnet
